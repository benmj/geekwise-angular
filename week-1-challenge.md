Write a todo list in JSfiddle using only core Javascript functions and the browser's API (don't use a library like jQuery, Angular, etc).

The application should have the following:

- an input box where the user can add a new "Todo"
- A button that submits the text from the input and adds the todo item to your list of todos
- The list of todos should be output to the user as an HTML list (`<ul>` filled with `<li>` tags)
- clicking the todo item marks it as done
    - it's up to you to determine what this looks like. How should the user get feedback to know that something happened? How can the user see old todos?
