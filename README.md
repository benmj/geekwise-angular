Javascript books, blogs, articles
---------------------------------

- Addy Osmani is a great person to follow. I especially recommend his book [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/), which he makes available for free on his website.
- [Javascript the Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742) is essential reading for anyone serious about crafting code in Javascript. It's not the easiest read, but it's worth your time and attention.
- [Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193398869X/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=193398869X&linkCode=as2&tag=jspro-20) by John Resig (creator of jQuery) is supposed to be good, but I haven't read it.

Javascript libraries
--------------------

- Even though this course isn't about [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com), learning about this framework is essential for the modern web developer. In many ways, AngularJS and jQuery have different philosophies, but they can play nicely together. IMHO, you'll want to know both, whether you choose to use them together on projects or not.
    - John Resig, the creator of jQuery, has a [website](http://ejohn.org/) where he blogs and shares snippets of books he's been working on. The archives on this site are actually really instructive.
- [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.com). This is an incredible library of tools for functional programming in javascript. It offers some incredible features and irons out some differences between Javascript implementations between older browsers. The documentation on the site is good, but terse. If you want to use it, I'd recommend finding a good tutorial.


Angular resources
-----------------

- [egghead.io](http://egghead.io) - a video series that we'll be using throughout the class
- [Angular Tips](http://www.angular-tips.com) - a new-ish blog on writing in Angular. I refer back to some of these posts pretty frequently.
- ng-newsletter
- #angularjs channel on freenode.net IRC. This is a chat room for all your angular needs
